# AnagramCheker
Write a program that determines if two strings entered by the user are anagrams. Two strings are considered anagrams if they contain exactly the same characters in the same or different order. It is necessary to consider that uppercase and lowercase letters are equal. Example of anagram: "amor" and "Roma".
